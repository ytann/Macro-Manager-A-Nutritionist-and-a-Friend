# Architecture

## Stack

FastAPI + Streamlit + SQLite (FTS5) + LiteLLM (ollama/gemma4:e2b) + httpx + Pydantic

## Component Map

```
app/
  api.py              FastAPI: POST /log/start, GET /log/status/{id}, POST /log, POST /vision-log, GET /summary (daily + weekly), /meals, /pending-count, /sync-status, POST /verify-queue, POST /goals, DELETE /clear, POST /planner. Lifespan manages heartbeat and closes FoodbankService.
  frontend.py         Streamlit: daily progress, static calendar week buffer, food journal, meal logging, goal settings, Clinical Copilot UI. Uses shared httpx.AsyncClient for pooling.
  core/config.py      Config: LITELLM_API_BASE, LLM_MODEL, DB paths, prompts path
  core/llm.py            LLM Utility: Global concurrency control (Semaphore) for Ollama stability
   schemas/food_schemas.py  Pydantic: Macros, SubMacros, FoodItem, FoodLog, LabelExtraction, GoalRequest

  services/
       database.py       DatabaseManager: 2 SQLite DBs (foodbank.db + macros.db).
                        FTS5 foods table, recipes, pending_verification, sync_status, meals.
                        Defines DEFAULT_FOODS for consistent seeding.
                        Implements weekly summary aggregation (static calendar week).
                        Provides `run_foodbank()` and `run_macros()` helpers for efficient thread-safe execution.
      foodbank.py       FoodbankService: Consolidated nutrition resolution logic. Implements Canonicalization Layer (fuzzy matching) and L1 in-memory caching to bypass DB/Web latency. Handles DB lookups, web search, offline estimates, and verification queue. Provides close() for resource cleanup.
       extraction.py     ExtractionService: Decoupled async pipeline (Item Extraction -> Background Resolution). Unified Resolution Engine (_resolve_and_build_log) for both text and vision paths. Vision pipeline handles multimodal payload (text + image + optional hint) for Home/Wild estimation.
       onboarding.py     OnboardingService: PMOS baseline macro calibration from user bio text using Pydantic validation for extracted attributes.
       planner.py         PlannerService: Clinical Copilot orchestration. Implements Router -> Knowledge -> Copilot flow with a Medical Firewall to prevent AI medical diagnosis.

## Data Flow

```
Onboarding Flow:
User Bio Text -> OnboardingService.calculate_pmos_baseline()
  -> LLM Extraction (onboarding_parse prompt) -> {height, weight, activity, goal}
  -> Math: BMR (Mifflin-St Jeor) -> TDEE -> Goal Modifier -> PMOS Penalty (0.85x) -> Macro Split (40/35/25)
  -> Persist to macros.db (goals table)

Food Logging Flow:
User Text -> ExtractionService.extract_items()
  1. Fast LLM extraction (prompts.yaml extraction.main)
  2. Returns {items, meal_id} immediately to UI
  3. Triggers Background Resolution via FastAPI BackgroundTasks:
     a. For each item:
        - Recipe check -> expand into base ingredients (parallel asyncio.gather)
        - Base ingredient -> get_nutrition_data():
           - L1 Cache lookup
           - Canonicalization Layer (Fuzzy match against DB)
           - DB lookup (FTS5)
           - [OFFLINE] cached data or LLM estimate (verified=0, queued)
           - [ONLINE] Authoritative web search -> General search -> LLM Expert Estimate -> Category Fallback (prevents 0-cal failures)
           - Standardized flat macro return for all paths
     b. Atwater guardrail (cal = P*4 + C*4 + F*9, correct if >20% deviation)
     c. Persist to macros.db
  4. UI polls GET /log/status/{meal_id} to update progress spinners.

Clinical Copilot Flow:
User Query -> PlannerService.plan()
  1. Router analyzes intent (General vs. Specific vs. Medical)
  2. Knowledge Loader fetches relevant PMOS guidelines from wiki
  3. Clinical Copilot generates empathetic plan (meal_copilot prompt)
  4. Medical Firewall validates output (Halt and refer if acute symptoms/prescriptions detected)
  5. Returns tailored plan + legal disclaimer to UI


Vision Pipeline (POST /vision-log):
   User Image (base64 + environment + optional hint) or Barcode/Label $\rightarrow$ ExtractionService.extract_from_image()
      1. Multimodal payload: text (vision_estimate prompt + hint) + image (base64) $\rightarrow$ gemma4:e2b (Two-step Analysis $\rightarrow$ Extraction)
         - For Labels: Prioritizes visual information, using OCR text as a secondary hint for accuracy.
      2. Environment rules: Home (~250-500g plates) vs. Wild (~300-600g plates)
      3. Returns [{name, grams}] items
      4. Pass to Unified Resolver -> build FoodLog
      5. Persist to macros.db (meal_type="Vision")



Heartbeat (asyncio task, lifespan-managed):
  Every 60s: check network -> process verification queue -> update sync timestamp
```

## Databases

### foodbank.db
- `foods` (FTS5 virtual table): name, aliases, calories, protein, carbs, fat, fiber, sugar, saturated_fat, unsaturated_fat, is_complete_protein, verified, source
- `recipes`: dish_name (PK), recipe_json
- `pending_verification`: name (PK), retry_count
- `sync_status`: id (PK), last_sync

### macros.db
- `meals`: id, meal_id, timestamp, items_json, total_protein/carbs/fat/cals/fiber/sugar/saturated_fat/unsaturated_fat, meal_type
- `goals`: id (PK), protein, carbs, fat, calories

## Key Design Decisions

- **Async**: All DB operations via `asyncio.to_thread`; all LLM calls routed through `safe_acompletion` (global semaphore) to prevent Ollama saturation; shared `httpx.AsyncClient` for connection pooling
- **Async Pipeline**: Decoupled extraction and resolution. Returns extracted items instantly and resolves nutrition as a background task to eliminate UI hang.
- **Canonicalization Layer**: Use of Levenshtein-based fuzzy matching to map item variations to DB entries, reducing slow web search triggers.
- **Self-Verifying Extraction**: High-recall single-pass LLM extraction to maximize recall while minimizing API latency
- **Recipe expansion**: Known dishes decomposed into base ingredients before macro calculation (anti-hallucination)
- **Offline-first**: DB cached data returned immediately when offline; unverified items queued for later sync
- **Atwater guardrail**: LLM calorie estimates validated against macro-derived calories
- **L1 Cache**: In-memory lookup for frequent food items to eliminate redundant DB/network roundtrips
- **PMOS Calibration**: Deterministic BMR/TDEE calculation with a 15% metabolic penalty to provide clinically relevant targets for insulin-resistant profiles
